This app will be deprecated shortly in favor of a React.js version. 

NOTE: Version 4.1 of this app is scripted using ES6 compliant javascript. This requires the scripts be built prior to being served in production. All required dependencies are in package.json. Create a preflight via webpack using Gulp and build using npm run build.
